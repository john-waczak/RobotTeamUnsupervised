\section{Introduction}

1. Classification is a common remote sensing and hyperspectral imaging problem
    - Endmember Identification and Spectral Unmixing is sub-problem specific to hyperspectral data

2. HSI Size allows their incorporation onto drones

3. Provided with in situ measurements, HSI can be used to predict a variety of relevant water quality and water composition parameters. Here we can describe our previous work

4. However, we would like to be able to identify the presence of spectral signatures for which we do not already have an in situ sensor. 

5. Unsupervised classification techniques are nice however standard algorithms like k-means clustering require prior knowledge of the number of constituent endmembers and do not, in general, provide any interpretable relationship between classes e.g. how is class 1 more similar to class 2 than to class 10. 

6. "In this paper, we extend our previous work into the unsupervised classification domain..." Here we demonstrate the application of Generative Topographic mapping which addresses these issues by providing a probability distribution of resulting classes. 

7. We apply the GTM to datasets collected by our Robot Team specifically showcasing the identification of spectral signatures for Rhodamine Dye, Algae, etc... 

8. With the signatures identified, class abundance, and therefore area estimation, can be performed rapidly, in real time, by utilizing the learned signatures with the nromalized spectral similarity score (or other similar metrics).

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Summary of GTM applications in our paper}
\subsection{Comparison to other existing approaches in literature}
- Is there much done for classification in real time? 
\subsection{Other applications of GTM}
- Discuss use of GTM means/modes/responsibilities feature transformer for supervised models (e.g. better than PCA) 
- Use of GTM classes to aid autonomous data collection by identification of "interesting" regons
