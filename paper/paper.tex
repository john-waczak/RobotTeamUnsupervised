\abstract{
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with hyperspectral imagers have emerged as an essential technology for the characterization of inland water bodies. The high spectral and spatial resolutions of these systems enable the retrieval of a plethora of optically-active water quality parameters via band ratio algorithms and machine learning methods. However, fitting and validating these models requires access to sufficient quantities of in situ reference data which are time-consuming and expensive to obtain. In this study, we demonstrate how the Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM), a Bayesian realisation of the Self Organizing Map (SOM), enables highly-detailed unsupervised classification and nonlinear endmember extraction of UAV acquired hyperspectral imagery. Specifically, the topographic relationship between classes maintained by the GTM presents an attractive alternative to other unsupervised approaches which do not provide a notion of similarity between learned classes. Using data collected across a North Texas pond, we apply the GTM to create a detailed map segmenting the area into distinct regions of interest. Further, by interpreting the learned classes as distinct endmembers, the GTM can be used to rapidly identify and map unique water constituents. We demonstrate this capability by using the GTM to map algal abundance as well as the dispersion of a rhodamine dye tracer released into the water.

\section{Introduction}

Inland water bodies present a unique challenge to characterization by remote sensing imagery due to their complex spectral characteristics and small scale spatial variability. The broad bands of multi-spectral imagers coupled with the irregular shape of lakes and rivers results in pixels with highly mixed signals that are easily dominated by reflectance from shore and near-shore vegetation sources \cite{koponen2002lake, ritchie2003remote}. Recently, the combination of hyperspectral imaging with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) such as drones has emerged as a powerful approach to simultaneously address the spectral, spatial, and temporal limitations of traditional high-altitude and satellite-based collection \cite{adao2017hyperspectral,arroyo2019implementation}. UAV are significantly less expensive to deploy than their remote sensing counterparts, and low altitude flights enable centimeter-scale sampling while limiting the need for complicated atmospheric corrections \cite{banerjee2020uav}. However, the significant increase in data volume generated by these systems presents a new challenge, namely, how to efficiently extract water quality parameters of interest from intricate pixel spectra.

Significant research efforts have focused on the development of techniques and algorithms to retrieve water quality parameters from UAV-captured hyperspectral images (HSI). On-board compute installed alongside hyperspectral imagers can enable the rapid evaluation of spectral indices from HSI band ratios \cite{horstrand2019uav}. These band ratios and polynomial combinations of bands have been used to successfully invert optically-active water quality parameters such as turbidity directly from UAV acquired imagery \cite{vogt2016near, zhang2022selection}. Supervised machine learning techniques such as tree-based models, support vector machines, and neural networks have also been used to estimate a plethora of parameters such as colored dissolved organic matter, chlorophyll a, blue-green algae, and suspended sediment concentrations \cite{keller2018hyperspectral, lu2021retrieval}. The calibration and evaluation of these data-driven models demand a significant volume of coincident, in situ data. This can be addressed by coordinating UAV flights with reference data collection using autonomous robotic boats \cite{robot-team-1, robot-team-2}. Nevertheless, this approach relies on prior knowledge of expected sources in order to select appropriate reference instruments for model validation. The presence of unanticipated contaminants cannot be directly identified in this sensing paradigm. 

Extending the capabilities of UAV-based hyperspectral imaging to enable water quality monitoring in real-time scenarios where contaminant sources may not be known in advance requires two additional capabilities: dimensionality reduction techniques to permit the visual comparison of HSI, and endmember extraction techniques which can identify spectral signatures corresponding to unique sources within the imaging scene. In remote sensing where reference data are typically sparse, many approaches have been explored. For example, principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) are dimensionality reduction methods commonly used to reduce HSI to two or three dimensions for visualization \cite{tyo2003principal,zhang2015hyperspectral}. Similarly for endmember extraction there are a variety of established approaches including geometric methods like vertex component analysis, statistical methods like k-nearest neighbors and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), and deep learning methods based on autoencoder architectures \cite{heylen2014review,nascimento2005vertex, Feng2022HyperspectralUB, cariou2015unsupervised, su2019daen, borsoi2019deep, palsson2020convolutional}. Methods based on linear mappings like PCA and NMF are often too restrictive for HSI where the assumption of linear mixing is easily broken. However, the increased complexity of nonlinear methods like tSNE and autoencoders often lead to significant increases in computation time. An ideal approach should enable both visualization and nonlinear identification of relevant spectral endmembers.

% neurons that wire together, fire together
The self-organizing map (SOM) developed by Teuvo Kohonen is an unsupervised machine learning method which non-linearly maps high dimensional data to the nodes of a two-dimensional grid \cite{kohonen-som-1}. By preserving the topological relationship between nodes during training, the SOM ensures that similar spectral signatures are mapped together such that related HSI pixels naturally cluster together. This presents an attractive compromise by enabling the simultaneous visualization of HSI data and endmember extraction via the weight vector associated with each SOM node \cite{cantero2004analysis, duran2007time,som-hsi}. When reference data are available, the SOM can be utilized to provide semi-supervised labeling of HSI spectra \cite{riese2019supervised}. Furthermore, Danielsen et al. demonstrated that the dimensionality reduction offered by the SOM can even be used for on-board data compression of HSIs acquired by a CubeSat \cite{danielsen2021self}. Despite these clear capabilities, the SOM relies on a heuristic training algorithm with hyperparameters that can be challenging to tune and offers no direct probabilistic interpretation. To address these limitations, Bishop et al. developed the generative topographic mapping (GTM), a Bayesian latent-variable model inspired by the SOM \cite{gtm-bishop-1}. The GTM has been utilized in a variety of domains including drug design and chemical data visualization but has yet to see adoption for the analysis of hyperspectral imagery \cite{kireeva2012generative, gaspar2015chemical, horvath2019generative}.

In this paper, we explore the application of the GTM to UAV-acquired HSI for the characterization water quality. Using data collected at pond in Montague, North Texas, we first train a GTM using water-only pixels to produce a low-dimensional representation of the collected HSI. We use this mapping to explore the highly detailed small-scale variability within the pond and discuss how this can be used to guide reference data collection. Next, we demonstrate how the GTM can be utilized to identify relevant spectral endmembers from a combined dataset including land pixels, algae, water, and a simulated contaminant plume using a rhodamine tracer dye. Once identified, these endmembers can be used to rapidly map the abundance of spectral features within the pond. We demonstrate this capability by mapping the abundance of algae near the shore and to track the evolution of a rhodamine dye plume.

In this study, we explore the use of the GTM as a tool for dimensionality reduction and non-linear endmember extraction of hyperspectral imagery. To this end, a dataset of HSI were collected at a pond in Montague, North Texas (shown in panel d of Fig~\ref{fig:sample-spectra}) on 23 November 2020 using a UAV mounted hyperspectral imager configured as described in \cite{robot-team-1, robot-team-2}. In this section we first provide a detailed overview of the GTM algorithm. Next we describe the UAV platform used for HSI collection and the various steps used to processes captured HSI. Finally, we describe the GTM training procedure, hyperparameter optimization, and subsequent visualization methods used to analyze trained GTM models in this study.

%%% --- Generative Topographic Mapping ------------------------------------
\subsection{Generative Topographic Mapping}


The GTM is a probabilistic latent variable model inspired by the SOM for visualizing and clustering high-dimensional data. Like the SOM, the GTM assumes vectors $\mathbf{x}$ in the $d$-dimensional data space (here representing reflectance spectra) are constrained to a low-dimensional embedded manifold. The SOM describes this manifold using a regular grid of nodes, each having an associated weight vector defining the mapping from the manifold to the data space. The position of each data record $\mathbf{x}$ in the manifold is assigned to the position of the node whose weight vector has the minimum Euclidean distance to $\mathbf{x}$. An iterative training procedure updates the weight vectors of each node to fit the manifold to the data such that nodes near each other in the SOM grid correspond to similar records in the data space.

The GTM mimics the grid of the SOM by assuming data are generated from latent variables $\xi$ which are constrained to the $K$-many nodes of a regular grid. This assumption corresponds to establishing a prior distribution on the latent space of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:latent-prob}
    p(\xi) = \frac{1}{K}\sum_k^K \delta(\xi - \xi_k)
\end{equation}
where $\delta(\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta function.

Points $\xi$ in this latent space are mapped to the embedded manifold by a non-linear function $\psi$ parameterized by weights $W$ as illustrated in Fig~\ref{fig:gtm-diagram}. However, since real data is rarely noise-free, this embedded manifold will not be perfectly thin. To account for this, the points $\xi$ are described in the data space by a radially symmetric Gaussian distribution, $\mathcal{N}(\psi(\xi),\, \beta^{-1})$, with mean $\psi(\xi)$ and variance $\beta^{-1}$. For a dataset $\left\{ \mathbf{x}_n\right\}\limits_{n=1}^N$ consisting of $N$-many i.i.d. records, this choice yields a log-likelihood function of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:llh}
    \mathcal{L}(W, \beta) = \sum_n^N \ln \left(\dfrac{1}{K}\sum_k^K p(\mathbf{x}_n \mid \xi_k, W, \beta) \right)
\end{equation}
which can be maximized to yield optimal $W$ and $\beta^{-1}$.

\begin{figure}[t]

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{paper/figures/methods/gtm-diagram.png}
%\end{adjustwidth}
\caption{Illustration of the GTM algorithm. On the left is a regular grid of $K$ many points (green) in the latent space represented by their coordinates $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$. In red are the $M$-many RBF which define the mapping $\psi$ from the latent space to the data space. Points in the latent space are mapped non-linearly to the data space yielding an embedded manifold in $\mathcal{R}^d$, here illustrated in three dimensions.\label{fig:gtm-diagram}}
\end{figure}  


The function $\psi$ is typically chosen to be given by the sum of $M$-many radial basis functions (RBF) evenly distributed in the latent space such that $\psi(\xi) = W\phi(\xi)$ with centers $\mu_m$ and width $\sigma$ so that
\begin{equation}
    \phi_m(\xi) = \exp\left(-\dfrac{\lVert \xi - \mu_m \rVert^2}{2\sigma^2}\right).
\end{equation}
Together the number of RBFs, $M$, and $\sigma$ are hyperparameters for the model which govern the smoothness of the resulting manifold in the data space. Additionally, sparsity of $W$ can be enforced by introducing an additional hyperparameter $\alpha$ corresponding to a prior distribution over the weights given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:weight-prior}
    p(W \mid \alpha) =  \left( \frac{\alpha}{2\pi} \right)^{MD/2}\exp\left(-\frac{\alpha}{2}\left\lVert W \right\rVert_{F}^2\right).
\end{equation}

The use of RBFs for $\psi$ enables maximizing $\mathcal{L}(W,\beta)$ via an Expectation-Maximization routine. During each step of the fitting process, the responsibility of the $k$th node for the $n$th data record is computed as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:responsibility}
    R_{kn} = p(\xi_k \mid \mathbf{x}_n, W, \beta) = \dfrac{p(\mathbf{x}_n \mid \xi_k, W, \beta)}{\sum\limits_{k'}^{K} p(\mathbf{x}_n \mid \xi_{k'}, W, \beta)}.
\end{equation}
Together these responsibilities form a matrix with entries $R_{kn}$ which are kept fixed during the maximization step. The maximization step is then performed by updating the weights $W$ and variance $\beta^{-1}$ according to
\begin{align}\label{eq:m-step}
    W_{\text{new}} &= \left(\Phi^T G \Phi + \dfrac{\alpha}{\beta}I \right)^{-1} \Phi^T R X  \\
    \frac{1}{\beta_{\text{new}}} &= \frac{1}{ND} \sum\limits_{n}^{N} \sum\limits_{k}^{K} R_{kn} \left\lVert \psi_k - \mathbf{x}_n \right\rVert^2
\end{align}
where $\Phi_{km} = \phi_m(\xi_k)$, $X$ is the data matrix formed by concatenating the records $\mathbf{x}_n$, and $G$ is a diagonal matrix with $G_{kk} = \sum\limits_n^N R_{kn}$. This process is repeated until the log-likelihood converges to a predetermined tolerance level.

Slices $R_{[:,n]}$ of the matrix $R$ define the responsibility of each latent node $\xi_k$ for the $n$th data record $\mathbf{x}_n$. Therefore the final responsibility matrix computed at the end of the GTM training routine can be used to represent each record in the latent space by the mean:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\xi}_n = \sum_{k}^K R_{kn}\xi_k.
\end{equation}

A freely available implementation of the GTM algorithm was developed for this study and is accessible at \cite{gtm-code}. The code is written in the Julia programming language and complies with the Machine Learning in Julia (MLJ) common interface \cite{bezanson2012julia,blaom2020mlj}.

\subsection{UAV-Based Hyperspectral Imaging}

A Freefly Alta-X autonomous quadcopter was used as the UAV platform in this study. This UAV was equipped with a Resonon Pika XC2 visible+near-infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral imager to capture HSI with $462$ wavelengths per pixel ranging from $391$ to $1011$ nm. This imager is in a pushbroom configuration so that HSI are captured one scan-line at a time resulting in data cubes consisting of $1000$ scan-lines with $1600$ pixels each. Additionally, the camera includes an embedded GPS/INS unit to enable georectification of collected HSI. An upward facing Ocean Optics UV-Vis NIR spectrometer with a cosine corrector was also included to provide measurements of the incident solar irradiance spectrum. Data collection and processing was controlled by an attached Intel NUC small-form-factor computer.

To account for the variability of incident light, raw HSI are converted to units of reflectance using the downwelling irradiance spectrum simultaneously captured with each HSI. With the hyperspectral imager oriented to nadir, the reflectance is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reflectance}
    R(\lambda) = \pi L(\lambda)/E_d(\lambda)
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the spectral radiance, $E_d$ is the downwelling irradiance, and a factor of $\pi$ steradians results from assuming the water surface is Lambertian (diffuse) \cite{ruddick2019review}. HSI collection was performed near solar noon to maximize the amount of incident sunlight illuminating the water. For the site in North Texas, this corresponded to an average solar zenith angle of $54.9^\circ$ for 23 November 2020 resulting in HSI with negligible sunglint effects.

After conversion to reflectance, each HSI must also be georectified to assign geographic coordinates to each pixel. The UAV flights were performed at an approximate altitude of $50$ m above the water so that the imaging surface is essentially flat. Consequently, HSI were rapidly georectified to a $10$ cm resolution using position and orientation data from the embedded GPS/INS as outlined in \cite{muller2002program, baumker2001new, mostafa2000multi}. An example hyperspectral data cube is illustrated in panel (a) of Fig~\ref{fig:spectral-signatures} where the log10-reflectance values are plotted along the z-axis for each pixel in the scene and a psuedo-color image at the top of the data cube illustrates how the water would appear to the human eye from the perspective of the UAV.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Summary of GTM applications in our paper}
\subsection{Comparison to other existing approaches in literature}
- Is there much done for classification in real time? 
\subsection{Comparison to Spectral Unmixing}
- Here we can re-interpret the GTM model as performing a type of Bayesian spectral unmixing and suggest how the method could be further extended to work in this domain. Critically, other traditional methods work by observing that pure endmembers form the vertices of a simplex. 

\subsection{Other applications of GTM}
- Discuss use of GTM means/modes/responsibilities feature transformer for supervised models (e.g. better than PCA) 
- Use of GTM classes to aid autonomous data collection by identification of "interesting" regons


- Drones can be equipped with HSI and compute to enable rapid generation of spectral indices like the NDVI for applications such as precision agriculture \cite{horstrand2019uav}

- Mention how Bishop suggests extensions to GTM for on-line learning which could be used to accelerate training for large HSI datasets
