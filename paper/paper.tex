\abstract{
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with hyperspectral imagers have emerged as an essential technology for the characterization of inland water bodies. The high spectral and spatial resolutions of these systems enable the retrieval of a plethora of optically-active water quality parameters via band ratio algorithms and machine learning methods. However, fitting and validating these models requires access to sufficient quantities of in situ reference data which are time-consuming and expensive to obtain. In this study, we demonstrate how the Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM), a Bayesian realisation of the Self Organizing Map (SOM), enables highly-detailed unsupervised classification and nonlinear endmember extraction of UAV acquired hyperspectral imagery. Specifically, the topographic relationship between classes maintained by the GTM presents an attractive alternative to other unsupervised approaches which do not provide a notion of similarity between learned classes. Using data collected across a North Texas pond, we apply the GTM to create a detailed map segmenting the area into distinct regions of interest. Further, by interpreting the learned classes as distinct endmembers, the GTM can be used to rapidly identify and map unique water constituents. We demonstrate this capability by using the GTM to map algal abundance as well as the dispersion of a rhodamine dye tracer released into the water.

\section{Introduction}

% 1. Traditional Strategies for Remote Sensing

Inland water bodies pose a unique challenge to characterization by remote sensing imagery due to their complex spectral characteristics and small scale spatial variability. The broad bands of multi-spectral imagers combined with the irregular shape of lakes and rivers results in pixels with highly mixed signals that are easily dominated by reflectance from shore and near-shore vegetation sources \cite{koponen2002lake, ritchie2003remote}. Recently, the combination of hyperspectral imaging with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as drones has emerged as a powerful approach to simultaneously address the spectral, spatial, and temporal limitations of traditional high-altitude and satellite-based collection \cite{adao2017hyperspectral,arroyo2019implementation}. UAVs are significantly less expensive to deploy than their remote sensing counterparts, and low altitude flights enable centimeter-scale sampling while limiting the need for complicated atmospheric corrections \cite{banerjee2020uav}. However, the significant increase in data volume generated by these systems presents a new challenge, namely, how to efficiently extract water quality parameters of interest from intricate pixel spectra.

% 2. Current Approaches

Significant research efforts have focused on the deveÄ§opment of techniques and algorithms to invert water quality parameters from UAV-captured hyperspectral images (HSIs). On-board compute installed alongside hyperspectral imagers can enable the rapid evaluation of spectral indices from HSI band ratios \cite{horstrand2019uav}. These band ratios and polynomial combinations of bands have been used to successfully invert optically-active water quality parameters such as turbidity directly from UAV acquired imagery \cite{vogt2016near, zhang2022selection}. Supervised machine learning techniques such as tree-based models, support vector machines, and neural networks have also been used to estimate a plethora of parameters such as colored dissolved organic matter, chlorophyll a, blue-green algae, and suspended sediment concentrations \cite{keller2018hyperspectral, lu2021retrieval}. The calibration and evaluation of these data-driven models demand a significant volume of coincident, in situ data. This can be addressed by coordinating UAV flights with reference data collection by autonomous robotic boats \cite{robot-team-1, robot-team-2}. Nevertheless, this approach relies on prior knowledge of expected sources in order to select appropriate reference instruments for model validation. The presence of unanticipated contaminants cannot be directly identified in this paradigm. 

% 3. Unsupervised ML

% To take full advantage of the information contained in HSI for near-real time water quality analysis, unsupervised methods that segment HSI pixels and can extract relevant spectral endmembers are needed. 

% A variety of technqiues have

% Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular choice for both dimenionsality reduction and feature extraction. 

% Principal component analysis (PCA) is a common method utilized for both dimensionality reduction and feature extraction

Unsupervised machine learning (ML) approaches have been widely explored for hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis, including dimensionality reduction, unsupervised classification, and endmember extraction and spectral unmixing. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), aim to represent the high-dimensional HSI data in a lower-dimensional space while preserving relevant information. However, PCA is a linear model, and t-SNE can be computationally complex. Unsupervised classification methods, including k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), fuzzy c-means, DBSCAN, matrix factorizations, and autoencoders, can identify clusters in the data, but do not directly aid in visualization. Robust Manifold Matrix Factorization has been used for both dimensionality reduction and clustering, while convolutional autoencoders with softmax have been employed for endmember extraction and unmixing. Additionally, stacked autoencoders and variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been combined for unmixing tasks. Endmember extraction and spectral unmixing techniques, such as geometric and statistical methods, vertex component analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), have been widely explored. While these methods can identify relevant endmembers, they often rely on the presence of pure pixels or require prior knowledge of the number of endmembers, which may not be valid in certain scenarios. Once endmembers are identified, abundance maps can be produced using techniques like spectral angle mapper or unmixing assuming a mixing model, but these do not directly facilitate visualization. The increased spatial resolution afforded by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms suggests that UAV-based HSI is ideal for endmember extraction, as the likelihood of pure endmembers is significantly higher than in satellite imagery. Consequently, unmixing of UAV-HSI has been used to discover endmembers for satellite HSI or as an endmember library. The goal is to develop a principled method that simultaneously enables dimensionality reduction and classification/endmember extraction for HSI analysis.

In this study, we explore the use of Generative Topographic Mapping as a tool for the unsupervised classification and nonlinear endmember extraction of hyperspectral imagery. To this end, HSIs were collected using a USV mounted hyperspectral imager at a pond in Montague, North Texas on on 23 November 2020 (shown in panel (d) of Fig~\ref{fig:sample-spectra}). In this section we shall first provide a detailed description of the GTM algorithm with subsequent subsections reserved to describe the specific data collection, processing, and analysis techniques employed in the study.

The Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) was developed by Bishop, Svens\'en, and Williams as a Bayesian realization of Kohonen's Self-organizing Map (SOM) \cite{gtm-bishop-1}. Specifically, the 

The Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) is an unsupervised latent variable model developed by Bishop, Svens\'en, and Williams \cite{gtm-bishop-1}. The GTM takes inspiration from Kohonen's self-organizing map which enables an unsupervised classification of high dimensional data into a (typically) two-dimensional grid of nodes such that nodes near each near each other in the mapping space



As outlined in the introduction, an effective unsupervised classification algorithm for hyperspectral imagery should accomplish the following three things: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Segmentation of captured imagery into a set of distinct classes
    \item Mapping of distinct spatial regions in collected imagery using the identified classes
    \item Simultaneous identification of relevant spectral endmembers
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{UAV-Based Hyperspectral Imaging}
A Freefly Alta-X autonomous quadcopter was used as a UAV platform for the robotic team.

The Alta-X is specifically designed to carry cameras and has a payload of up to 35 lbs. We equipped the UAV with a Resonon Pika XC2 visible+near-infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral imager. 

For each image pixel, this camera samples 462 wavelengths ranging from 391 to 1011 nm. 

Additionally, the UAV includes an upward facing Ocean Optics UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer with a cosine corrector to capture the incident downwelling irradiance spectrum.

Data collection by the hyperspectral imager is controlled by an attached Intel NUC small-form-factor computer. 

A second processing NUC is also included for onboard georectification and generation of data products.

The collected hyperspectral images (HSIs) are stored locally on a solid state drive that is simultaneously mounted by the processing computer.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Summary of GTM applications in our paper}
\subsection{Comparison to other existing approaches in literature}
- Is there much done for classification in real time? 
\subsection{Comparison to Spectral Unmixing}
- Here we can re-interpret the GTM model as performing a type of Bayesian spectral unmixing and suggest how the method could be further extended to work in this domain. Critically, other traditional methods work by observing that pure endmembers form the vertices of a simplex. 

\subsection{Other applications of GTM}
- Discuss use of GTM means/modes/responsibilities feature transformer for supervised models (e.g. better than PCA) 
- Use of GTM classes to aid autonomous data collection by identification of "interesting" regons


- Drones can be equipped with HSI and compute to enable rapid generation of spectral indices like the NDVI for applications such as precision agriculture \cite{horstrand2019uav}
